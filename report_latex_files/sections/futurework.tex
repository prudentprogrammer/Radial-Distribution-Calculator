\section*{Future Work}

There are many aspects to this application that could be improved or extended further. The most important extensions are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Additional Distribution Functions:} The application can be readily extended to compute and visualize other distribution functions of interest, such as e.g. the angle distribution function $g_{ABC}(\theta)$ describing the angles defined by the bonds formed between atoms of species A, B and C.
	
	\item \textbf{Comparison with Experimental Data:} If an experimental pair distribution function is added to the existing graph, the user can effectively analyze and compare the result of the simulations to the actual experimental observations. Through this extra feature, the user can perform a more comprehensive analysis and validate the models used in the simulations against experimental data.

  \item \textbf{Generation of Publication Quality Diagrams:} Adding a button which generates a publication quality image could add more value to the application.  

\end{itemize}
