There are many aspects to this application that could be improved or extended. However, some additions which could be helpful for the application are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Experimental Curve: If an experimental curve is added to the existing graph, the user can effectively analyze and compare the result of the simulations to the actual experimental observations. Through this extra feature, the user can perform a more comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the atoms on a particular substance.

  \item Generation of Publication Quality Diagrams: Adding a button which generates a publication quality image could add more value to the application. This is because if the user wants to test a particular hypothesis or perform some analysis and save the image with high resolution, he or she can perform the export operation with ease. 

\end{itemize}
