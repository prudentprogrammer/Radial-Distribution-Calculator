\section*{Goals}

In order to develop a portable and flexible analysis tool, we define a number of goals that are further expanded below. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Interactivity / Interactively Visualize and Compare} }: The result of simulations is often static in the sense that if certain output values need to be generated, the corresponding script or program has to be re-run. In other words, there is no dynamic adjustments that can be made to the program when it is running. The application being designed in this project achieves this in the simplest ways through a simple slider. The user can adjust the slider to select a sub-interval of the entire simulation, and see the output graph change accordingly. This type of interactive control could easily be extended to other parameters.
    
    \item \textbf{\textit{Flexibility / Process data from any location} }: In most cases, if a user wants to execute a script with a certain input file, the user has to download the input data file and run the scripts on the local downloaded data. However, this approach is not very flexible. Our application aims to eliminate this issue by adding flexibility to the input sources. In other words, the data which is input into the program can be a local file or a remote file (URL) located on a server. From this behavior, any user can simply point the application to the input source and the entire application efficiently processes the input without any issues. 
    
    \item \textbf{\textit{Scalability/ Compare one or two simulations on the same graph} }: Even if the application is interactive and flexible, visualizing only one simulation at a time may be insufficient. A user might want to answer interesting questions through the comparison of two different simulations simultaneously. This application is scalable in a sense that it can visualize one or two graphs together, thereby allowing for comparative studies. 
    
    \item \textbf{\textit{Portability/ Runs on any platform} }: \textbf{Portability is probably the most important goal in this project.} In order to create a powerful and a simple application at the same time, the user has to be able to download and run the application on any platform with the minimum amount of libraries required. The entire structure of this application was designed based on these needs to enhance portability.
