\section*{Conclusion}
The main goal of this project was to build a portable visualization tool to analyze atomic trajectories and their corresponding radial distribution functions in various substances through interactive means. This goal was demonstrated by running the application on simulation data from water and silicon first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Portability and interactivity were achieved through the use of Python and Javascript. More specifically, Python was used as a means of computing the radial distribution function on any platform. Once this was performed, another Python script generated an html page containing the Javascript code to effectively visualize the distribution function and create an interactive interface. This allows the user to use the controls on the web page to dynamically analyze the distribution functions and export the desired graphs. Extensions to other distribution functions and more detailed interactive control of the parameters will be considered in future work.
